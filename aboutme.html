                <p class="para1"> 
                    Hi! I'm Saumya Chavali, a former insurance professional turned aspiring web developer. 
                    With over 9 years of experience in the insurance industry in Australia across various roles in the business, I have developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and project management skills, which I now bring to my web development projects.                    
                    My passion for technology and desire to create led me to pursue a career in web development. 

                </p>
                <p class="para2">
                    I have completed coding bootcamps and training, built several projects, and continually work to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.
                    I specialize in front-end development, with a keen eye for creating user-friendly and responsive designs. My recent projects include a portfolio website and a Hotel Reservation website where I successfully implemented modern design principles and best practices in web development.
                    I am excited about this career change and eager to contribute to innovative web development projects. My goal is to combine my background in insurance with my new technical skills to create solutions that enhance user experiences and streamline business processes.
                </p>
                <p class="para3">
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy travelling and have been to various countries across the globe learning about history, culture and food.
